Step 1) Import assignment.sql file to the database.
Step 2) Copy the project files in server folder... 
	or you can pull from github also https://github.com/rohitlalwani999/assignment_roshanji.git
Step 3) Update Database Connection Credentials if other then default in add_item.php assignment.php and remove_item.php file.
Default is:
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
	
Step 4) just browse for the project url like localhost/projectfolder name.

Thanks :)
